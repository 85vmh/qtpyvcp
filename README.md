QtPyVCP is a Qt and Python based framework for building virtual control panels
for the LinuxCNC machine control.

The goal is to provide a no-code, drag-and-drop system for making simple VCPs,
as well as a straightforward, flexible and extensible framework to aid in
building complex VCPs.


## Installation and Usage

See the [documentation](https://qtpyvcp.com/).

## Dependancies

* LinuxCNC 2.8^ or master
* Python 2.7
* PyQt5 or PySide2

QtPyVCP is developed and tested using the LinuxCNC Debian 9 and 10 x64 (stretch and buster)
[Live ISO](http://linuxcnc.org/downloads/). It should run
on any system that can have PyQt5 installed, but Debian 9 and 10 x64 is the only OS
that is officially supported.
