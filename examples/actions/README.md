 # QtPyVCP Action Examples

This VCP has examples of all the actions. You can run as a simulation by
copying the action configuration directory from the configs directory.

1) Install with pip:
   Open a terminal in the action directory then
  `pip install -e .`

2) Edit the layout in QtDesigner by opening a terminal in actions/actions
  `editvcp actions`

3) You can have this open in the Designer and copy the widgets you want
   to your GUI.
